# Descriptive-and-Inferential-Statistics-Mini-Project

This repository contains a step-by-step project to help students and professionals learn and apply key concepts in **Descriptive and Inferential Statistics**. Through practical problems and Python-based solutions, you will gain a deeper understanding of statistical analysis and its real-world applications.

## **Introduction**

Statistics is a fundamental skill for data analysis and decision-making. This mini-project aims to provide hands-on experience in computing, interpreting, and applying statistical measures using Python. Each task is carefully designed to build knowledge incrementally, covering foundational definitions to advanced concepts like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

## **Project Outline**

### **Q1: Key Statistical Definitions**
- Definitions for Population, Sample, Descriptive and Inferential Statistics, Parameter, Statistic, Qualitative, and Quantitative Data.

### **Q2: Measures of Central Tendency**
- Definitions and examples for Mean, Median, and Mode.

### **Q3: Manual Calculation of Central Tendency**
- Calculate Mean, Median, and Mode for a given dataset.

### **Q4: Levels of Measurement**
- Definitions and examples for Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio scales.

### **Q5: Variance and Standard Deviation**
- Theoretical understanding and comparison of these measures of spread.

### **Q6: Manual Calculation of Variance and Standard Deviation**
- Compute sample variance and standard deviation for a dataset.

### **Q7: Range and Interquartile Range (IQR)**
- Arrange data, calculate Range, Q1, Q3, and IQR.

### **Q8: Five-number Summary and Boxplot Concept**
- Understand the five-number summary and the use of boxplots to detect outliers.

### **Q9: Confidence Interval for the Mean**
- Calculate a 95% confidence interval for a given dataset.

### **Q10: Hypothesis Testing - One Sample Z-Test**
- Perform a hypothesis test to evaluate a given claim using the Z-test.

## **Expected Outcomes**

1. **Statistical Proficiency**: Develop a clear understanding of descriptive and inferential statistics.  
2. **Practical Application**: Perform confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing.  
3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Analyze datasets and derive meaningful insights for real-world scenarios.
